    <div>Thank you for registering with our system. Unfortunately, due to obvious compliance limitations we are not able to grant access to student management portion of our site. This doesn’t mean that you can’t utilize our Career Assessment tools.  You can still do so on our publicly available sections:</div>

    <div>This also doesn’t mean that we disregard needs of Elementary School Counseling community. Our technology team is working on developing ways to allow you and your students to fully participate with our system, while staying compliant with the protocol.  As soon as we are ready with the new version, you will be dutifully notified.</div>
