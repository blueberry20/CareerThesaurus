    <div>Hey {{name}},</div>
    <br>
    <div>You’re almost done! lol jk</div>
    <div>But seriously, a good start is half the battle. You registered– that’s good!</div>
    <div>Now, let’s get to the fun part. Let’s figure out together what your ideal careers are, according to your current views of the world. (Don’t worry – it’s way easier than your chemistry test!)</div>
    <br>
    <div>When you log on, complete your assignment in 3 easy steps:</div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <dl>
                <dt><b>Step 1. Pick Top 3 Life Interests that are Important to You.</b>
                <dd>If you select a tag by mistake, just click on it again to unselect it, but you must select 3 MOST IMPORTANT things in total.
            </dl>
        </li>
        <li>
            <dl>
                <dt><b>Step 2. Answer all 9 questions of the Personality Assessment test.</b>
                <dd>Tip: Try to imagine yourself in the work environment when you answer these questions. For example, you may be an Extrovert (very social) when you go out, but prefer to be left alone at work, so you would need to select Introvert as your answer.
            </dl>
        </li>
        <li>
            <dl>
                <dt><b>Step 3. Review results and vote for your most (and least) favorite professions.</b>
                <dd>After you take the test, you will be presented with a list of careers that closely match your personality and life interests. Don’t think of them as the ONLY careers that you would be a perfect fit for, but rather think of these occupations as the Approximate Prototypes of your ideal career. Try to grasp the common essence that unifies these results for you. Don't be overly ambitious, going beyond top 10 best and worst choices will counterproductive.
            </dl>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div><b>NOTE:</b></div>
    <ul>
        <li>You MUST vote YES for those careers that definitely interest you.</li>
        <li>Voting NO is optional, but doing so will help us shape your profile better.</li>
        <li>Skipping irrelevant careers is Ok.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>Once you complete the assignment, you will get a report card, which is actually a fun read!</div>
    <br>
    <div>At this point, you really are done! No joke.</div>
    <br>
    <div>Talk later,</div>
