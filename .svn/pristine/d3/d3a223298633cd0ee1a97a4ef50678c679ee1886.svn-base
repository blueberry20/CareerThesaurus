You thrive on collaboration and love to exchange ideas with your colleagues. A noisy office area or crowded conference room is the best place for you to get creative and find solutions to challenges. Your colleagues love the fact that you are able to approach just about anyone, so you may find yourself representing your team at meetings or off-site events where social skills are just as important as business skills. You'll have no problem succeeding at these events, as networking with others is a breeze for an extravert like you. Working with others gives you the energy you need to produce top results.
