var desc = 'You excel in careers that require a great deal of concentration, especially when you are able to work in a quiet environment that does not have a lot of distractions. Colleagues and supervisors rely on you to buckle down and focus on the details, as your personality makes it easy for you to get through marathon work sessions that would get the best of other employees. Your ideal work environment is one that has very little foot traffic, as you do not like to be disturbed by visitors or people who have to walk past your work area to get to other parts of the office.';
