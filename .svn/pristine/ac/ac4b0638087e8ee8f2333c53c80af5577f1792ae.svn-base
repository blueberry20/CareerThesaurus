While some people prefer to deal with concrete information when making decisions, you rely on your instincts to guide you. Emotions and feelings play an important role in your decision-making process, so you are used to dealing with some level of uncertainty on the job. Your ability to roll with the punches helps you succeed in the toughest work environments, and colleagues rely on your gut feelings to guide them in making their own decisions. You have a high level of emotional intelligence, so you excel in careers that require the ability to read other people and use the information you gather to make decisions.
