                Initial results are presented in a relevance order.  It is useful for students to SORT them by salary and popularity.
                Such sorting will allow them to view the careers that are most in demand and have the highest compensation.
                Also, students should GROUP their results by education, this way they can match their careers with the corresponding educational requirements.
            </p>
            <p>Career review and rating begins with careers matched by Interest, followed by review/rating careers by personality.</p>
