var desc = 'Your approach to problem-solving allows you to thrive in careers that require creativity and imagination. Rather than filling your mind with statistics and facts, you prefer to rely on your own imagination to come up with solutions and innovative ideas for new products or services.

Managers especially appreciate your ability to come up with unique ways to solve problems.';
