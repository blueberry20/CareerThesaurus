# CareerThesaurus
.NET project that presents a career test for students to take, and provides them with matching careers based on their answers. I did all front end work for this project.


In order to view html files got to CareerThesaurus/SkillCowResponsive/Views.
You'll see views for each corresponding page so you can select which one to use.

In order to find css and image files inside the project, go to CareerThesaurus/SkillCowResponsive/Content. CSS files are named according to html page names, so it should be easy to match them.

In order to find js files go to CareerThesaurus/SkillCowResponsive/Scripts
