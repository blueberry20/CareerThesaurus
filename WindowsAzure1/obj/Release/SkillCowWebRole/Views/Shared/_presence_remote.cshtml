When it comes to interacting with colleagues, supervisors, and clients, you prefer e-mail and telephone conversations to actual face time. You thrive when you are able to work off-site, especially if you are able to make your own schedule. Freelance jobs and non-traditional jobs appeal to you because they give you the freedom to set your own hours and work when you are at your peak performance. Clients and managers don't mind giving you a lot of flexibility, as you achieve the best results when you are allowed to set your own pace and decide when and where you will work.
