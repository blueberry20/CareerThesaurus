When it's time to make a decision, you are most comfortable when you have enough time to gather a great deal of information. You use this information to guide you in examining all of the possibilities and picking the one that makes the most sense. Supervisors and colleagues rely on your ability to thoroughly research an issue before making a decision, as your rational approach prevents them from making hasty decisions that they will regret later. You prefer to avoid making split-second decisions, but you have the ability to do so if required. A research-heavy job is something you enjoy rather than dread.
